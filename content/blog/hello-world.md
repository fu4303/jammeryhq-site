You may know both of us from the Gridsome discord chat, where we both help out when ever possible. 

While building various sites using Gridsome, we've identified a number of areas that we can potentially improve. We'll be sharing the details of how we see this working and how we see this benefiting Gridsome as a whole in a future post, but for now please take a moment to fill out our short survey, which will help us determine where our efforts would be best
