## Marcus joins the team

Both Travis and I have long admired the work of fellow Gridsome community member, Marcus Reynolds. In order to achieve our vision for Jammery, we decided to expand the team. Marcus brings a wealth of experience to the team and started adding value from day one. 

## Our utility starter and cli

To continue along the JAM theme, we've decided to name our upcoming utility theme Jello. We feel this is a good fit, given the fluid nature of jelly and the configurable nature of the starter.

Marcus is currently working on our Content Normalisation plugin for Gridsome, which acts as the bridge between a starter and content source.

Travis is hard at work fine-tuning our CLI, which can be used to scaffold new Gridsome based projects, letting to select which data sources, plugins and layouts are needed for the specific project.
