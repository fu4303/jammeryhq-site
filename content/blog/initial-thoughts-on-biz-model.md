excerpt: We've been considering various business models for Jammery and we feel we've struck a great balance between building a sustainable business, while still contributing back to the community and projects we support.

While there is merit in each of the models we looked at, we're leaning towards a club / subscription model with a twist. 

Our goal for this new collaboration is two-fold. On the one hand, we need to put food on the table and sustain ourselves while working on Jammery fulltime and on the other, we want to contribute back to the JAMstack community.

So, with that in mind, we're leaning towards a model where members get early access to our Gridsome starters, component library and detailed setup guides. This way, members get access to our new goodies as they are released, but then after a set period (for example 6 months) they are made available to everyone.

Members of the club would have the ability to vote on which starters, components and guides they would like created first, along with the ability to suggest new starter, component or guide ideas.

In addition to the ongoing stream of content, members would also get exclusive access to our Excelsior starter and CLI. In-case this is the first you're hearing of Excelsior, it's our utility starter which includes consistent layouts for all the major Gridsome sources, plugins and popular NPM packages. 

The idea is that using our CLI, you scaffold a new project and follow the prompts to select which sources, plugins and packages you want included. After about 60 seconds your new site is ready to go, with everything you need and nothing you don't. You can see an early preview of the CLI in action over here.

We're also structuring the configurable parts as separate modules to make it easy to add or remove stuff as needed.

Then for the starters, we're leaning towards releasing a new starter every three months, which will give us enough time to maintain a high level of quality, which still being able to work on Excelsior, the component library and guides.

The idea behind the component library is to create a collection of rock-solid building blocks, that can be used within our starters, plugins and other tools. Yes, there are already some great component libraries out there (like Vuetify, Chakra Vue, etc), but each of them utilize their own CSS frameworks, meaning extending them means learning a new set of classes and way of doing things. We are big fans of TailwindCSS and will be using it for all of our starters, plugins and components, so it made sense to stick to one framework and use it for everything. 

Then lastly the guides, the idea here is create detailed, step-by-step guides covering setting up the various Gridsome sources, plugins and relevant NPM packages. 

The official Gridsome docs are constantly evolving and what we have so far is already pretty good, but there are still a ton of things I personally needed to figure out while building my personal sites, that aren't covered. 

Things like implementing live-search, using Airtable, setting up authentication are just three topics off the top of my head. The number of guides we commit to releasing each month is yet to be determined, but I think five really detailed guides would be realistic. 

Like the starters and components, the guides would be locked to members only for a set period, then made public to all once the countdown has concluded.
