excerpt: Kabolobari is a designer and software interface engineer. He has built a career mainly on ways things should be built, and pioneered a body of knowledge called “The Golden Ratio of Good Design,” which he teaches at meetups, schools, and conferences. His work intersects product, brand, and user experience design.

He is South African born, but has lived in London, Argentina, Brazil and visited the US, Malaysia, Paraguay, Sweden, Scotland and Zimbabwe.

Outside of work Chris is interested in permaculture / sustainable food farming, free energy systems, primitive technology and working on my various side-projects.

He is also known to speak at tech conferences from time to time and post the occasional youtube video.
