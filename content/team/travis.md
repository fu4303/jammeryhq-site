He is South African born, but has lived in London, Argentina, Brazil and visited the US, Malaysia, Paraguay, Sweden, Scotland and Zimbabwe.

Outside of work Chris is interested in permaculture / sustainable food farming, free energy systems, primitive technology and working on my various side-projects.

He is also known to speak at tech conferences from time to time and post the occasional youtube video.
